# Mars Weather App

---

Do you want to check the current weather on Mars? You can do it now.

ðŸŽ‡ Check the [current weather on Mars](https://katemat.github.io/weather-app)

## Overview

This is a single page app, creating with:

- vanila JavaScript,
- HTML,
- Sass
- Nasa API to fetch weather data

NASA API: Insight - Mars Weather Service API

This API provides per-Sol summary data for each of the last seven available Sols (Martian Days).

NB! For this project I used DEMO_KEY, so please take into account that there is a limitation of requests you can do per day.
